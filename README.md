[![Vercel Deployment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployed%20on-Vercel-brightgreen)](https://calender-events-two.vercel.app/)

This project is a **Dynamic Event Calendar Application** built with React.js, TypeScript, and Vite, showcasing advanced logic, clean UI design, and seamless deployment.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Calendar View**:
  - Displays a dynamic monthly calendar grid.
  - Navigate between months using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Event Management**:
  - Add events to specific days by clicking on a date.
  - Edit or delete existing events.
  - Each event includes:
    - Name
    - Start and end time
    - Optional description
- **Event List**:
  - View all events for the selected day in a modal.

### Advanced Logic
- Ensures no overlapping events (e.g., two events at the same time).
- Automatically handles month transitions and edge cases like leap years.
- Highlights the current day and selected date for better UX.

### Data Persistence
- Stores all events using **localStorage**, ensuring data is preserved across page refreshes.

### Exportable Events
- Export event lists for a specific month as **JSON** or **CSV**.

### UI Design
- Built with **ShadCN components** for a modern and intuitive design.
- Distinguishes weekends, weekdays, and highlights current/selected days.

## Bonus Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling**: Move events between days effortlessly.
- **Event Categorization**: Apply color codes for event types (Work, Personal, Others).
